    <h1>Hello, Codeworks!</h1>
    <p>My name is Chris and today, I learned quite a bit. I've learned how to run a server from my computer.
    </br>
        I've also learned how much easier it is to use Visual Studio as opposed to a program like notepad++.
    </br>
        Here's something interesting about me; despite living in Idaho for the majority of my life, its the only state I've lived in where I have not gotten a tattoo.
